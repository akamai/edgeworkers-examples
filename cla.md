# Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") allows for the contribution of code to this project, i.e. akamai/edgeworkers-examples (the "Project") and is intended to establish that each Contribution is subject to the licenses specified below. Specifically, this Agreement allows an individual to submit Contributions to the Project – or an entity (a "Corporation") to submit Contributions to the Project or to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees – and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project. Except for the license granted herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is accepting this Agreement. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation, or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You for inclusion in the Project.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Akamai, the Project's maintainers, contributors, and users, and to recipients of software distributed by Akamai, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Akamai, the project's maintainers, contributors, and users, and to recipients of software distributed by Akamai, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that one or more of your Contributions, or the Project to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for those Contributions or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses, and You represent further that each employee of the Corporation designated by You is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.
5. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
