# Akamai EdgeKV 
Akamai Edge Key-Value (EdgeKV) is a low-latency, distributed key-value store built to complement EdgeWorkers. EdgeKV enables you to build data-driven JavaScript applications that require fast, frequent reads and infrequent writes. This repo contains the API documentation for EdgeKV, the helper library for EdgeWorker bundles, and utilities to make using the product easier. Joint EdgeWorker/EdgeKV code samples that implement various EdgeKV use cases can be found [here](https://github.com/akamai/edgeworkers-examples/tree/master/edgecompute/examples).
