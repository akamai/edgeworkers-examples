# Akamai EdgeWorkers Examples


Akamai EdgeWorkers helps deliver superior web experiences by enabling developers to run JavaScript at the Edge to customize web traffic, rather than using origin servers for these tasks. EdgeKV provides a global, low-latency key-value data store at the Edge to complement EdgeWorkers. The code snippets in this repository represent a starting point to help you build logic that will solve a range of use-cases via Akamai EdgeWorkers and EdgeKV.

These code samples are offered as-is, and are working code samples within the EdgeWorkers and EdgeKV products.  Feel free to use, modify and extend what you find here!
