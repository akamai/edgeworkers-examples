# Akamai EdgeWorkers Examples

Akamai EdgeWorkers helps deliver superior web experiences by enabling developers to run JavaScript at the Edge to customize web traffic, rather than using origin servers for these tasks.  The code snippets in this repository represent a jumping-off point to help you build logic that will solve a range of challenges in your own web experiences via Akamai EdgeWorkers.

These code samples are offered as-is, and are expected to be live, working code samples within the EdgeWorkers product.  Feel free to use, modify and extend!
