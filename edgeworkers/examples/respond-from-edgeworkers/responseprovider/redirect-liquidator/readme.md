# RedirectLiquidator
The RedirectLiquidator EdgeWorker silently transforms `301/302` into a `200` response.

The benifits of this approach are
* No redirect
* New content
* Updated URL

From a high level perspective the EgdeWorkers does 3 steps:
* Manages super fast redirects at the Edge
* Chases redirects from the origin
* Injects `<history.replaceState>` in the response body of the `200` response

## What is Redirect Liquidation
Instead of serving a response with a `301/302` redirect we directly serve the actual content (`200`) and inject 1 extra line of JavaScript in the <head> section. 

`<script>history.replaceState(null, "","/new/url.html");</script>`

This JS snippet updates the original URL without triggering a redirect. This is done using the `history.replaceState` method from the History API. The History API is well supported with an adoption rate of 96%+.

## What about bots?

This feature should not be enabled for bots (eg. Google Crawler). When a bot crawls an outdated link they must receive the original 301/302 response.
This can be done based on User Agent matching or more correctly using Botman and the technique (described here)[https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2020/02/25/improve-performance-and-seo-tuning-crawlers].
  
  
  
## Q&A
**Isnâ€™t this the same as redirect chasing available in Property Manager?**
Redirect chasing is great, however the result is a `200` on the original URL. While Redirect Liquidation also covers updating the URL in the browser.

**What is the difference with a forward rewrite?**
Forward rewrites are a perfect use case to serve content over a different URL. A forward rewrite returns a `200` but does not change the original URL seen by the enduser.

**Could you do this at the origin**
Yes, this technique is nothing specific to Akamai EdgeWorkers. However depending on your CMS/Framework this might be too complex or not even possible at  all.
