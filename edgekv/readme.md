# Akamai EdgeKV Examples
Akamai Edge Key-Value (EdgeKV) is a low-latency, distributed key-value store built to compliment EdgeWorkers. EdgeKV enables you to build data-driven JavaScript applications that require fast, frequent reads and infrequent writes. The code snippets in this repository represent a jumping-off point to help you learn about EdgeKV, and how it integrates with EdgeWorkers.
These code samples are offered as-is, and are working code samples. Feel free to use, modify and extend what you find here!
