# HLS Module 

The hls module can be used to demonstrate EW's capabilities of dynamically creating personalized versions of hls manifests based on parameters like device type, user geography, request headers or query string parameters.

## Limitations


## Files
* **hls.js** is the main class you import in your main.js file. This file provides helper functions such as parseManifest to construct object from the manifest & populateManifest to reconstruct manifest back using objects.
* **hls.d.ts** is the typescript declaration file for hlsparser module.
